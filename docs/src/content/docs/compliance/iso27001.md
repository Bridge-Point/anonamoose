title: ISO 27001 Compliance
description: How Anonamoose maps to ISO 27001 Annex A information security controls.
---

ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). Organizations pursuing ISO 27001 certification must implement controls from Annex A to manage information security risks. Using LLM APIs introduces risks around data leakage and unauthorized disclosure that require appropriate controls.

## The problem

When an organization sends data to an LLM API, several ISO 27001 risk areas are triggered:

- **Information leakage** — Sensitive data is transmitted to a third party
- **Inadequate data classification** — PII may be included in prompts without awareness
- **Insufficient access controls** — Individual developers may send any data to the API
- **Lack of monitoring** — No visibility into what data leaves the network

Anonamoose addresses these risks as a technical control that sits between your application and the LLM API.

## Relevant Annex A controls

### A.8.2 — Information classification

> Information shall be classified in terms of legal requirements, value, criticality, and sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure or modification.

**How Anonamoose helps:**

The four-layer detection pipeline automatically classifies information in outbound requests:

| Layer | Classification capability |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Dictionary** | Organization-defined sensitive terms — names, internal identifiers, project codes |
| **NER (Local AI)** | AI-based classification of person names, organizations, locations |
| **Regex** | Pattern-based classification of emails, phone numbers, government IDs, financial data |
| **Name Detection** | Common name identification from known name databases |

Each detection includes a category label (EMAIL, PHONE, PERSON, SSN, etc.) and confidence score, providing structured classification of sensitive data.

The Redaction Inspector allows manual testing of classification rules against sample data.

### A.8.11 — Data masking

> Data masking shall be used in accordance with the organization's topic-specific policy on access control and other related topic-specific policies, and business requirements, taking applicable legislation into consideration.

**How Anonamoose helps:**

- PII is replaced with unique, meaningless tokens (pseudonymization/masking)
- The masking is reversible within your infrastructure via rehydration, allowing the response to contain the original values
- Masking is applied automatically to all proxy requests by default
- The LLM processes only masked data — it never sees the original values
- Masking rules are configurable via the settings API (enable/disable layers, adjust NER confidence)

### A.8.12 — Data leakage prevention

> Data leakage prevention measures shall be applied to systems, networks, and any other devices that process, store, or transmit sensitive information.

**How Anonamoose helps:**

This is Anonamoose's primary function — preventing sensitive data from leaking to LLM APIs:

- Acts as a mandatory gateway between your application and the LLM API
- Four detection layers provide defence in depth against data leakage
- Dictionary layer provides guaranteed detection of known sensitive terms
- All redaction activity is logged and visible in the admin panel
- Detection statistics are tracked on the dashboard

### A.5.34 — Privacy and protection of personal information

> The organization shall identify and meet the requirements regarding the preservation of privacy and protection of PII as required by applicable legislation, regulations, and contractual requirements.

**How Anonamoose helps:**

- Prevents PII from reaching third-party LLM providers
- Supports compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, Privacy Act) by minimizing data disclosure
- Token mappings are stored locally with automatic TTL expiry
- Session management provides data subject rights support (access, deletion)

### A.5.23 — Information security for use of cloud services

> Processes for acquisition, use, management, and exit from cloud services shall be established in accordance with the organization's information security requirements.

**How Anonamoose helps:**

When using cloud-based LLM APIs:

- Anonamoose provides a technical control layer between your systems and the cloud service
- Reduces the data classification scope of the cloud service relationship (only de-identified data is processed)
- Simplifies the security assessment of the LLM provider — less sensitive data means lower risk
- Self-hosted deployment keeps the control layer within your security boundary

### A.8.10 — Information deletion

> Information stored in information systems, devices, or in any other storage media shall be deleted when no longer required.

**How Anonamoose helps:**

- Sessions have configurable TTL with automatic expiry and cleanup
- Individual sessions can be deleted via `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/:id`
- All sessions can be purged via `DELETE /api/v1/sessions`
- Dictionary entries can be removed individually or flushed entirely
- Request logs and redaction logs can be cleared via API

## Statement of Applicability mapping

For your Statement of Applicability (SoA), Anonamoose can be referenced as a technical control for:

| Control | SoA reference |
|---------|--------------|
| A.8.2 | "Automated PII classification via four-layer detection pipeline in LLM proxy" |
| A.8.11 | "Automated data masking/pseudonymization of PII in outbound LLM API requests" |
| A.8.12 | "Data leakage prevention control for third-party LLM API communications" |
| A.5.34 | "Technical measure for PII protection in AI/LLM processing workflows" |
| A.5.23 | "Security control layer for cloud LLM API usage" |
| A.8.10 | "Automated data deletion via session TTL and manual purge capabilities" |

## Evidence for certification audits

| Evidence type | Source |
|--------------|--------|
| **Control documentation** | Pipeline architecture, detection layer documentation |
| **Operational records** | Dashboard statistics, request logs, redaction logs |
| **Configuration records** | Settings API output, enabled layers, confidence thresholds |
| **Testing records** | Redaction Inspector test results |
| **Access control records** | API_TOKEN authentication, admin panel login |
| **Data retention records** | Session TTL configuration, expiry logs |

## Deployment recommendations for ISO 27001

1. **Include in your ISMS** — Document Anonamoose as a technical control in your risk treatment plan and Statement of Applicability.

2. **Define classification rules** — Use the dictionary to define organization-specific sensitive terms that map to your information classification policy.

3. **Set retention periods** — Configure session TTL to align with your data retention policy.

4. **Monitor and review** — Regularly review dashboard statistics and redaction logs as part of your ISMS monitoring activities.

5. **Test effectiveness** — Use the Redaction Inspector as part of your internal audit program to verify control effectiveness.

6. **Document procedures** — Create operational procedures for dictionary management, session purging, and settings configuration.

## Limitations

- Anonamoose is a technical control within your ISMS, not a complete information security management system.
- ISO 27001 certification requires organizational controls, risk assessments, management commitment, and continuous improvement processes.
- Anonamoose processes text content only. Images, audio, and binary data require separate controls.
- The NER model provides high but not 100% recall. The dictionary layer compensates by providing guaranteed detection of known terms.
