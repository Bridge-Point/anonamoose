## Why Anonamoose?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Guaranteed Redaction" icon="approve-check">
    Dictionary-based rules are **never bypassed** by probabilistic detection. If you add a term, it will always be redacted — 100% recall.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Three-Layer Pipeline" icon="list-format">
    Dictionary → Regex → NER. Each layer catches what the previous might miss, from explicit terms to algorithmic patterns to context-aware detection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Rehydration" icon="random">
    Tokenized placeholders using Unicode Private Use Area characters allow deterministic restoration of original values after LLM processing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Drop-in Proxy" icon="rocket">
    Point your OpenAI or Anthropic SDK at Anonamoose and PII is automatically redacted on the way in and rehydrated on the way out. Full streaming support.
